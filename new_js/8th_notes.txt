add event listener is just the method 
syntax: .addEventListener("click",function(){
    ..... work of the function
});
whenever click event takes place then this function is called automatically . does not need to make the function call

child scope can have access to the parent scope even if it is not in a same scope.

scope chain example is the illuatration of the above code..

var is function-scoped . and let  and const are the block-scoped

outer scope cannot have access to the inner scope varibales or values.  
parent scope cannot have access to the child scope here .


scope chain works from inside to outside . not the either way 
the variables declared with var is 
function scoped not a block scope
// only when strict mode is used
any function lying inside block scope is also not accessable outside the block.

.......................
this keyword alsways points to the owner of that function
value of this functionis not static 
depends on how the function is actually called, value is assigned when the funtion is called

this keyword will never be used to call function or variable enviroment
if any variables is created by var then it lies in  global windows and hence it can be access in the arrow function. 
.................................
arguments keyword only exists in the regular function not the arrow function less used it is not used usually 

const new_var_name = Object.assign({},new_obj_name)
it is the way in which new object is assigned in a seperate memory(or a simple process to copy the old object to the new one )
