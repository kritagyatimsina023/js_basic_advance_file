nothing much just about variable name how the variable name should be assigned which makes easier to nunderstand .

datatypes:..................
there are total 7 primitive datatypes in js 
number: floating point number used for decimals and integers.

string: sequences of characters , used for text 
boolean: logical type mthat can only be true and false .used for decisions making .
undefined: values taken by the variable but not yet defined empty values.

Null: also means empty values
symbols: less used
Bigint: larger integers than the number type can hold

note: js do not need to define varibales dynamically . datatypes are defined automatically. 

console.log(typeof null);
which shows and object that is simply an bug  
........................................

// let, const, var ...............
let is basically used for mutating the values (i.e. defining the values and again changing the values of the varibales with the new ones) like age can be changed

const values ones defined cannot be changed later (immutable variables) like date of birth year (DOB) cannot be changed ones defined correctly

var less used 


............................... 
 type conversion and type coercion 
 type conversion is manually converted my use himself  and type coercion is converted by js in BTS . implicityly 

 type conversion str to number using number function  NaN is not a number which means invalid number but its type is number still  

 i type coercion js wil automatically convert str to number by default doesnot requires any functions 

 .............................
 truthy and falsey values
 undefined,null,0 are falsey values .
 for truthy values 1 and any other numbers are truthy values


...........................
=== doesnot performs type coercion that is also called strict. 
==  is also called loose equality operator . which performs type coercion

..............................
switch statements 
 const variables = 'monday'
 switch(variables){
    case 'monday':
        console.log("its monday)
        break;
 }

 if emoji the windows button + .(dot)

 js release and version
 first mocha ma made in just 10days(very first version of js )
 microsoft copied js from netscape
 later es(called ecmascript 5) was developed 
 and now we are using es6(with a lot of features) now es will apply cycle of annual change evey year instead of establishing new version 
  
  js is backward compactible that means the old methods syntax is still applicable in the new versions but it is not forward compactible.
