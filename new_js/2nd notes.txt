strict mode helps developers to prevent from different errors or visible errors simply write 'use strict'

...................
function is also an values such that it can be stord in a variables .
in function declaration function can be called before declaring it(i.e function call can be done before defining the actual function )
but in function decalration it cannot be done this is due to hoising 

mostly function expression is used because it becomes necessary to call declare the function before calling it

arrow function syntax 
for single parameters
const var_name = parameters =>{

}

for multiple parameters
const var_name = (para1,para2) =>{

}
................
array
another way to from an array 
const var_name = new Array(1233,1243,213,434) etc 

array_name.length is the property of an array which is not zero based (i.e counting does not start from 0)
array is only zero based (i.e counting starts from 0 ...)
we can mutate array even though it is declered with const 

array methods are:
push :add elements to the end of array
unshift: to add element to the front of the array.

pop: to remove the end elements of an array.

shift : to remove the first elements from the array.
indexOf: to determine the index of an element within array
includes: simply returns true if the element is with in array and false if the element is not within array

another data structure is object. 
curly braces . key => var_name

 inside object content are called property.
const obj_name = {
     key : values,
    key1 : values1,

}
conclusion; array should be used for ordered data where as object should be used for unstructured data.

if computation has to be done within the property of the object then brackets has to be used. else for simply fetching the property of the object then simply .(dot) is used
