spread operator can be used when we want to access individual element of an array   
iterables are array strings maps but not object
new way of copying object is 
const new_obj = {...previous object name }
new obj is created in new memory location 
... is spread operator which is useful in array and copying object 


....................
rest is used to pack an array while spread operator is used to unpack an array
rest is used becaues the ramaining elements of array is kept in new array such that ... is used in LHS 
it takes multiple values and packs on to the array
..........................
advance AND and OR operations 
so in advance OR operations 
it finds for truthy value if certain value is true then returns truthy value immeditely ....
for and operations if it finds falsy value then it returns falsy value immediately doesnot care about truthy value . and if all of them are truthy value then it will simply return last value
